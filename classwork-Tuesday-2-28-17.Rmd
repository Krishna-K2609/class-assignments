## Classwork for Tuesday Week 8

Here I will include my classwork for Tuesday 28 February.

### Loading my first data file

Load in the csv file I created.

```{r cats}
cats <- read.csv(file = "data/feline-data.csv", as.is = TRUE)
# adding as.is = TRUE will keep character data as characters
cats
str(cats)
cats$weight

# we can change values in a column
cats$weight + 2

typeof(cats$weight)
# double - same as float in python
typeof(cats$coat)
# coat is strangely recorded as an integer in R
# R reads all values as factors
typeof(cats$likes_string)
# integer

as.character(cats$coat) -> dd
# convert coat to text rather than factors
```
R uses the $ to retrieve vectors in a csv file.
