    "*Is it accurate to claim that fossil records near the tropics correspond to cold-blooded dinosaurs while those found towards the polar regions correspond to warm-blooded ones?*   \n",
    "*The plots have too many dinosaurs! Would have been useful to subset the data and show only a few dinosaurs or a selected family/genus.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**09:34 Justin Shieh**  \n",
    "*Interesting to learn that cetaceans share a close common ancestor with hippopotamuses!*   \n",
    "*What is the expected link between body mass/brain size and survival rates/longevity?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**09:38 Sarah Kim**  \n",
    "*Why are wolves the most common fossil? The charts were slightly confusing and may need tweaking.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**09:42 Christina Zhou**  \n",
    "*Interesting to note that even though bats are successful, they do not fossilize well so the historical record is limited. Why is this the case?*   \n",
    "*Cool iPython notebook design.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**09:46 Gayane Hovsepyan**  \n",
    "*Why does the first peak in diagnosis occurs at around 2-3 years of age?*\n",

    "*Interesting to note the narrow distribution of the longest-range birds!*\n",

    "**10:10 Marina Salama**    \n",
    "*In the final plot, why is there a gap in data? Is this due to measurement errors?*\n",
    " \n",
    "**10:14 Erin Solis**    \n",
    "*Stable speciation rates but very high extinction rates! Is this due to environmental (e.g. climate variability) or anthropogenic factors (land use change, etc)?*\n",

    "**10:18 Sean Mathew**    \n",
    "*Cool animation! It might be useful to add a title to each map in the animation to indicate the period that the map is depicitng.*\n",
